# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project utilizes a web-based interface to estimate home prices in Bangalore based on certain parameters.

## Overview

The project includes an HTML interface (`app.html`) that allows users to input area square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and select a location to predict the estimated house price.

## File Structure

- `app.html`: HTML file for the user interface.
- `app.css`: CSS file for styling the interface.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file handling user input and sending requests to the prediction API.
- `bengaluru_house_prices.csv`: Dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- `Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data analysis and model building.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `app.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter the area square footage, select bedrooms, bathrooms, and a location.
4. Click on "Estimate Price" to see the predicted house price.

## Requirements

- Ensure a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- Python environment with required libraries for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for running the Jupyter Notebook.
